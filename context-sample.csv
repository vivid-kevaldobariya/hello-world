WE'RE CELEBRATING WITH SOMETHING SPECIAL. IT'S TIME TO WORK TOGETHER.

IT'S TIME TO WORK TOGETHER AS A COMMUNITY. COLLECTIVELY RIDE 200 MILLION LOGS TO UNLOCK A <COLOR=""RED"">NEW GAME MODE</COLOR>.

EVERY PARTICIPANT WILL ALSO WIN A SPECIAL ONE-TIME-ONLY CHICKEN.

<color=""yellow"">HOP TO IT!</color>","This text decribes our latest update. In this update we are running a community even where all users will collectively ride / collect 200,000,000 ""logs"" in the game. Please retain the <size> and <color> tags as these are markup that changes how the text is displayed and these tags should not be translated, but it would be great if they can be included in the translated text around the appropriate phrases. As a reward for participating in this community event, the users will be awarded a one-time-only figurine/character that is not otherwise available, and will also unlock a new game mode that will also be available to future users. We want to emphasise that it is a communal and community effort. It's important to note that the goal of 200,000,000 is a community goal, and not a requirement of each individual user."
